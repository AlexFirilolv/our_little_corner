Project: Our Little Corner 💖
A simple, private web app to celebrate our relationship and cherish our moments together.

## Goal
The goal is to create a beautiful and personal digital scrapbook. It's a dedicated space for us to look back on our favorite memories—photos and videos—each with its own special note. This is a surprise for International Girlfriends Day!

## Core Features
💌 Media Gallery: A visual grid of all our uploaded photos and videos for her to see.

✍️ Rich Notes & Captions: The ability to add a personal, richly formatted note or a sweet caption to every single memory.

🔐 Simple & Secure Access: The main gallery is protected by a single, shared password.

🔑 Session Persistence: Remembers you after you've logged in once from the same browser, so you don't have to enter the password on every visit.

🤫 Hidden Admin Panel: A private admin dashboard, accessible only via a direct URL (/admin), for me to easily upload new media and manage content.

☁️ Secure Storage: All media will be stored in a public Amazon S3 bucket.

✨ Cute & Simple UI: A clean, adorable, and easy-to-navigate design for the main gallery.
