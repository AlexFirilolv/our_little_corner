# Twofold

**Twofold** Is shared 'locket' (journal) web application designed exclusively for couples. It serves as a dedicated digital space to document a relationship, celebrate milestones, and cherish daily moments.

## Goal
To move beyond a simple photo dump and create a "Digital Locket" — a living history of the relationship that includes photos, videos, written notes, locations, and future plans.

## Core Features

### 📖 The Shared Timeline
A reverse-chronological feed of the relationship.
* **Mixed Media:** Support for photos, videos, and text-only "Love Notes."
* **Media Metadata Extraction** Uploaded media that includes metadata for date and time of taken photo, where it was taken (location), etc, will be imported automatically to visualize the timeline and location travel of the couple.
* **Double Helix Design:** A visual thread connecting all memories, allowing multiple ways to view it, and an option to filter.

### 🗺️ Our Journey
* **Interactive Map:** Visualizes the couple's travel history, connecting geotagged memories with a path.
* **Milestone Tracker:** A dedicated view for major life events (First "I Love You", Trips, Moving In), styled distinctly from daily posts.
* **Flashbacks:** "On This Day" feature to surface memories from previous years.

### 📝 Shared Lists
* **Bucket List:** A shared checklist for future dates, travels, and goals.
* **Favorites:** Keep track of movies to watch or restaurants to try.

### 🔒 Privacy & Security
* **Couples-Only Access:** The platform is sealed to just the two partners.
* **Secure Storage:** Media is stored privately in Google Cloud Storage Buckets.

## User Roles
Unlike the previous iteration, there is no "Admin" vs. "Viewer."
* **Partners:** Both users have equal rights to upload, edit, and view all content. The experience is perfectly symmetrical.
