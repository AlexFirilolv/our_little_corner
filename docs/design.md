# Design & UI/UX 🎨

**Twofold** is designed as a "Digital Locket"—an intimate, private space for two. Unlike the previous design, there is no separation between "User" and "Admin." Both partners are equal creators in this shared journal.

## Design Philosophy
* **Concept:** A Digital Locket. Intimate, romantic, and deeply personal.
* **Vibe:** Cozy, secure, and nostalgic. It feels less like a social feed and more like high-quality stationery.
* **Interaction:** Focus on "Us." Every element visualizes the shared journey.

## Color Palette
Moving away from standard pastels to a deeper, more romantic and grounded palette.

* **Primary (Brand):** `#BA4A68` (Deep Rose) - Used for primary buttons and active states.
* **Background:** `#FDF6F7` (Blush Paper) - A very pale pink/cream, providing a warm, paper-like texture.
* **Card Background:** `#FFFFFF` (Pure White) - With subtle rose-tinted shadows.
* **Text (Primary):** `#4A2C35` (Dark Truffle) - Softer and warmer than black.
* **Accent/Milestone:** `#C8A659` (Muted Gold) - Used for anniversaries, milestones, and special highlights.

## Typography
A pairing that mimics a personal letter or wedding invitation.

* **Headings:** *Playfair Display* (Serif). Elegant, high-contrast.
* **Body & UI:** *Lato* (Sans-serif). Friendly, round, and highly readable.

## Core Experiences & Screens

### 1. The Timeline (Home)
* **Layout:** A vertical feed connected by a **Double Helix** line (intertwining paths) in faint gold/rose, symbolizing two lives becoming one.
* **Header:** Combined profile picture of the couple + "Time until" countdown (e.g., "14 days until anniversary").
* **Cards:**
    * **Photo Entry:** Media with personal captions.
    * **Love Notes:** Text-only entries on textured paper backgrounds (e.g., "Just thinking of you").
    * **Reactions:** Custom animated icons (Blowing Kiss, Hug, Heart Eyes).

### 2. Our Journey (Explore)
A visualization of history rather than just a gallery.
* **Map View:** World map with pins for geotagged memories. Lines connect pins chronologically to show the "path traveled."
* **Milestones:** A vertical list of major relationship events (First Date, Moved In, Engagement) highlighted in Muted Gold.
* **On This Day:** A persistent widget showing memories from previous years.

### 3. Creation (Upload)
A simplified, frictionless menu replacing the standard file picker.
* **Options:** "Add Photo/Video", "Write Love Note", "Log Milestone".
* **Context:**
    * **Date:** Backdatable for historical inputs.
    * **Location:** emphasized for the Map View.

### 4. Profile & Settings (Us)
* **Shared Bucket List:** A checklist of things to do together (movies, trips, dates).
* **Countdown Management:** Set the next big event.
* **Relationship Settings:** Anniversary date, etc.
